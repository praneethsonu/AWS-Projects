# Build a Virtual Private Cloud

The core of AWS networking by creating your very own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

Setting up and managing a VPC is a vital skill for anyone looking to master cloud infrastructure. Today, you'll learn how to set up and configure a VPC from scratch.

Let's get ready to:

1. ‚òÅÔ∏è Create an Amazon VPC.
2. ü•Ö Create a public subnet.
3. üö™ Create an internet gateway.

# STEP #2

# Create Subnets

15. Nice! We've created our VPC, so it's time for the next step...creating a public subnet. Here's what it looks like in an architecture diagram:

16. Subnets are subdivisions within your VPC where you can launch AWS resources.
17. In the VPC Dashboard, under Virtual Private Cloud, choose Subnets.
18. Ooo, there are already subnets in here!

20. Configure your subnet settings:
     VPC ID: NextWork VPC.
     Subnet name: Public 1
     Availability Zone: Select the first Availability Zone in the list.
     IPv4 VPC CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16
     IPv4 subnet CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/24

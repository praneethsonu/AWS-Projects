# Cloud Security with AWS IAM
Let's use IAM to control access to our AWS resources.

# Introduction to the project.

In AWS, a user is a person or a computer that can do things on the AWS cloud.

You use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use your account's resources.

Get ready to create (Tools):

1. üíª EC2 instances
2. üìè IAM Policies
3. üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß IAM Users and User Groups
4. üîñ AWS Account Alias

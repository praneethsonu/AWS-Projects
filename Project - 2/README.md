What is Amazon S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) enables the storage of objects that can
be accessible anywhere on the cloud. An object can be any type of file such
as images, videos, documents, and more. The power of S3 lies in its high
availability, scalability,

How I used Amazon S3 in this project
I used S3 for static website hosting. By uploading the HTML file and Folder
where all files like images are present and uploaded in an S3 bucket and
making them publicly accessible on the internet.
